"Community Connect" is a health resource web application that aims to consolidate information about businesses and organization available in communities that promote healthy lifestyle choices. A health resource is defined as services or materials that improve the quality of life of others, ranging from affordable child care, substance abuse counseling, domestic violence support, and more. We are working in conjunction with Massachusetts General Hospital's [Center for Community Health Improvement](https://www.massgeneral.org/cchi/), MGH Revere HealthCare Center, and Revere CARES Coalition to create an extensive database in our pilot region of Revere, Chelsea, Charlestown, and eventually the Greater Boston Area.

## History
The original architectural design for this app was designed proven out by [Bob Breznak](https://github.com/bobbrez) for an organization assisting with the refugee crisis in Greece in 2016, [Prosper](http://prosper.community/). They needed help consolidating, vetting and displaying resources on the web. In May 2018 he re-wrote the frontend in react.js to create an app that assists homeless people [Seeking Shelter](https://makao2.brez.io/) and resources. In August 2018 Code for Bostonâ€™s Community Connect project had similar aims and the repo was moved into their org. The data used for this project was initially collected from [Nevil Desai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nevildesai/) during his internship with Revere CARES, a coalition group under the umbrella of MGH Center for Community Health Improvement.
